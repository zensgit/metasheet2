# Amount Server-Side Total Check — Design Lock

Status: IMPLEMENTED BY #3176; FOLLOW-UP GAPS TRACKED

Grounding: the amount-tier approval line — design-lock
`approval-amount-tier-template-presets-design-lock-20260624.md` plus the Gate-A
approval-node source editor (#3124) — shipped with a written KNOWN CONTROL
LIMITATION (Decision 1 of that lock): the amount gate reads the applicant-entered
top-level `amount`, so a submitter can **under-state the total to route around the
higher-amount approval tier**. That line is closed; this is a NEW, narrow lock that
closes only that one gap, server-side. It is the lighter of the two documented
fixes — the heavier one, detail-row auto-sum, is a separate later lock.

## Goal

**Bind the number that drives tier routing to the line items the approver actually
sees.** When a template declares an amount-consistency mapping, the backend
validates at SUBMIT time that the applicant-entered total equals the sum of that
submission's detail-row amounts, and **rejects a mismatch fail-closed** before the
approval graph is built.

Scope of the guarantee, stated precisely (this is a control, not magic):

- It CLOSES the decouple — routing on a top-level `4000` while the line items sum
  to `8000` (under-stating only the routing field to dodge the tier) is rejected.
- It does NOT make amounts truthful. A submitter who under-states the total AND the
  line items *consistently* still routes low — that is a truthfulness problem
  (approver review, downstream reconciliation), outside this control's reach. Do
  not describe this as "tamper-proof"; it binds routing to the visible line items,
  it does not verify the line items are honest.

It does NOT compute or auto-fill the total (that is detail-row auto-sum — a separate
lock delivering the SAME routing guarantee with different ergonomics; see
Non-Goals). It validates an applicant-supplied total against the applicant-supplied
rows.

## Decisions

1. **Explicit declared mapping — never inferred.**
   The check runs ONLY when the template config declares an `amountConsistencyCheck`
   mapping `{ totalFieldId, detailFieldId, amountColumnId }`. No field-name
   convention, no "find the amount field" heuristic — both are brittle and fail
   OPEN. A template without the mapping is unaffected (no check). This mirrors the
   G-5 discipline: the editor offers only what the backend explicitly accepts; the
   control engages only on an explicit, validated declaration.

2. **Server-side, fail-closed, at submit time.**
   The check lives in `createApproval` (`ApprovalProductService`), AFTER
   `pruneHiddenFormData` and BEFORE the runtime graph is built, so it sees exactly
   the normalized `formData` the graph will route on. On a mismatch it raises a
   validation error (HTTP 400, precise but non-leaking message) and the approval is
   never created. A FE preview MAY mirror it for UX, but — as with
   `normalizeApprovalGraph` — the backend is the SOLE arbiter and the preview never
   relaxes it.

3. **Exact comparison on a money-safe representation.**
   Compare `total` against `sum(rows[*][amountColumnId])` in integer minor units
   (or a fixed-scale decimal), NEVER raw IEEE float — `0.1 + 0.2` drift must not
   create a phantom mismatch. The scale is derived from the mapped number fields'
   declared precision (approval `FormField.props`, aligned with the multitable
   `property.decimals` convention where present), not hard-coded to "currency = 2".
   When no precision is declared, the helper must preserve the submitted decimal
   precision with an exact decimal parser/normalizer rather than rounding both
   sides to two places. It then sums and compares exactly. No tolerance band in v1
   (a money control is exact); a configurable epsilon is out of scope.

4. **Mapped fields must be unconditionally visible; value gaps fail closed.**
   `pruneHiddenFormData` (`ApprovalGraphExecutor`) prunes at TWO granularities —
   whole top-level fields (by visibility), and individual CELLS within each detail
   row (a sub-field `visibilityRule` evaluated per row, recursing the sub-schema).
   It does NOT drop whole rows — the row-array length is preserved. So the dangerous
   edge is a mapped field/cell being pruned AWAY, not a row vanishing.
   - To remove that ambiguity entirely, the mapping REQUIRES its three referenced
     fields — the total field, the detail field, and the amount column — to carry NO
     `visibilityRule` (unconditionally visible), enforced at template-save
     (fail-closed authoring). They can then never be pruned, so the check always has
     well-defined inputs and reads the SAME post-prune `formData` the graph routes
     on.
   - With that guaranteed, value gaps still fail closed: a non-numeric/absent total,
     a non-array detail value, or a row whose amount cell is empty/non-numeric →
     reject (the control cannot verify a row it cannot read). The form-schema layer
     enforces field TYPES; this check enforces VALUE consistency on a type-valid
     submission.

5. **One total ↔ one detail column, v1.**
   v1 maps exactly one top-level total to exactly one `number` column of one
   `detail` field. Multi-detail roll-ups, nested details (the model is one nesting
   level regardless), cross-field arithmetic, and currency conversion are out of
   scope.

6. **Persistence: versioned `formSchema.amountConsistencyCheck` (as built in #3176) —
   the dedicated-column requirement is WITHDRAWN.**
   An earlier draft of this decision required a dedicated `amount_consistency_check`
   column on the parent template and argued AGAINST putting it in `form_schema`. That
   was wrong: `form_schema` (and `approval_graph`) live on
   `approval_template_versions`, not the parent `approval_templates`, so a
   parent-template column would DRIFT from the version a running instance is pinned
   to. #3176 instead put the mapping at `formSchema.amountConsistencyCheck`,
   normalized + re-emitted in `assertFormSchema` (`normalizeAmountConsistencyCheck`)
   and read in `createApproval` — version-pinned and explicitly allowlisted (not an
   un-allowlisted key the form-schema normalizer would drop). This lock adopts that
   home. The G-5 silent-drop risk does NOT disappear — it MOVES to the FRONTEND save
   path: the `apps/web` `FormSchema` type and `buildFormSchema()` must carry
   `amountConsistencyCheck` through, or the editing page rebuilds the schema without
   it and drops the mapping on first save (Remaining gaps §1).

## Mapping shape and authoring-time validation

`amountConsistencyCheck?: { totalFieldId: string; detailFieldId: string; amountColumnId: string }`
sits at `formSchema.amountConsistencyCheck` (version-pinned with the rest of the
form schema), is normalized + re-emitted in `assertFormSchema`, and is validated at
TEMPLATE-SAVE time (fail-closed authoring), mirroring the assignee-source allowlist
discipline:

- `totalFieldId` references a top-level field of `type: 'number'`.
- `detailFieldId` references a top-level field of `type: 'detail'`.
- `amountColumnId` references a `type: 'number'` entry in that detail field's
  `columns` (leaf sub-fields; the model already forbids nested `detail`).
- none of the three referenced fields carries a `visibilityRule` — they must be
  unconditionally present so the check always has its inputs (Decision 4).
- the comparison scale is derived from the mapped number fields' declared precision;
  a missing precision declaration does NOT imply "round to two places".

A mapping that points at a missing or wrong-typed field is REJECTED at save — the
unsupported-config gate, not a runtime surprise. A template carrying an
`amountConsistencyCheck` whose shape the backend does not re-emit is fail-closed in
the authoring UI exactly as G-5 handles unknown approval-node keys.

The amount-tier presets that motivated this lock MUST declare the mapping when the
runtime slice lands. In particular, the shipped purchase amount-tier preset needs
`{ totalFieldId: 'amount', detailFieldId: 'purchase_items', amountColumnId: 'amount' }`
so the high-tier route is actually controlled by the line-item total. Presets that
omit the mapping remain valid drafts, but they do NOT get this control.

## Build Gates

### Gate A — submit-time check + fail-closed unit tests
A pure `validateAmountTotalConsistency(formSchema, normalizedFormData, mapping)`
helper (no DB), unit-tested both directions:
- matching total ↔ row sum → passes;
- under-stated total (the bypass) → rejected;
- over-stated total → rejected;
- mapped fields with any `visibilityRule` → rejected at template-save (the submit
  helper never has to guess whether a pruned value should count);
- decimal precision cases: `0.1 + 0.2` vs `0.3` passes, and a higher-precision
  mapped amount (for example four decimal places) is not rounded to two places;
- non-numeric total / non-array detail / non-numeric amount cell → rejected;
- no mapping → no check (the helper is never invoked).

### Gate B — real-DB acceptance
A real-DB `createApproval` + create/update-template, mirroring the create-template
smoke:
- `formSchema.amountConsistencyCheck` survives a template save→reload round-trip AND
  a FRONTEND editing-page save, NOT dropped by normalization (the Remaining-gaps §1
  silent-drop regression);
- template WITH the mapping + a mismatched submission → REJECTED, no approval row
  written;
- same template + a matching submission → `201` + created;
- a mapping referencing a `visibilityRule`-bearing field → REJECTED at template-save;
- the amount-tier preset mapping is persisted on create and survives readback;
- template WITHOUT the mapping → unaffected (no check path executed).

### Gate C — no scope creep
The check only ever REJECTS; it NEVER mutates `formData` (no auto-fill — that is
the auto-sum lock). No currency conversion, no multi-detail, no tolerance band.

## Remaining gaps (open follow-ups — #3176 shipped the capability, the gap is NOT fully closed)

Tracked here, none in #3176. Sequence matters: FE preserve FIRST (it is the base
save-path fix the rest depends on), THEN the preset mapping (a mapping added before
the FE preserve would be dropped by the editing page on the next save), then the
visibility policy.

1. **[P1] FE authoring save silently drops the mapping.** The backend type carries
   `FormSchema.amountConsistencyCheck`, but `apps/web/src/types/approval.ts`
   `FormSchema` still has only `fields` and `buildFormSchema()` returns `{ fields }`
   — so a template saved through the editing page loses the mapping (the G-5
   silent-drop, now on the FE side). Fix: FE `FormSchema` type + `draftFromTemplate`
   hydrate + `buildFormSchema` preserve + a mounted round-trip test.
2. **[P1] Amount-tier presets do not declare the mapping.** `commonTemplatePresets.ts`
   carries no `amountConsistencyCheck`, so the capability ships unused and the
   amount-tier preset gap stays open. Wire reimbursement
   `{ totalFieldId: 'amount', detailFieldId: 'expense_items', amountColumnId: 'amount' }`
   and purchase `{ totalFieldId: 'amount', detailFieldId: 'purchase_items', amountColumnId: 'amount' }`,
   with shape + real-DB coverage. DEPENDS on §1 (else an edited preset loses the mapping).
3. **[P2] `visibilityRule` policy mismatch.** This lock (Decision 4 / Mapping shape /
   Gate B) asserts a SAVE-TIME reject of `visibilityRule`-bearing mapped fields, but
   `normalizeAmountConsistencyCheck` validates existence + type only — the shipped
   behavior is fail-closed at SUBMIT (a pruned mapped field → absent value → reject),
   not at save. Align one way: add the save-time reject, OR ratify "submit-time
   fail-closed" and drop the save-time claim from those three places.

## Non-Goals
- Detail-row auto-sum (computing/auto-filling the total) — separate later lock. It
  delivers the SAME routing guarantee as this check (bind the routing total to the
  visible line items), NOT a stronger one — a consistent low-baller defeats both
  identically. It differs in ERGONOMICS (compute-and-lock the total vs
  validate-and-reject) and is the larger surface (a computed/rollup form-field
  capability). "Check first" is an ordering-by-cost call, not a claim auto-sum is
  weaker.
- Currency conversion / multi-currency arithmetic.
- Multi-detail roll-ups or cross-field arithmetic.
- A tolerance/epsilon band (v1 is exact).
- Inferring the total/amount fields by name or heuristic.
- `job_title` / `rank` resolver and W7 approval-result write-back (their own locks).
