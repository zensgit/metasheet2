# A6-2 — suspend/resume runtime (admin-gated v1) — verification (2026-06-03)

> Verifies the impl against the design-lock `multitable-automation-a6-2-suspend-resume-design-20260603.md`
> (#2236). Backend-first; frontend (A6-2b) deferred. Built on a fresh worktree off `origin/main`.

## What shipped

- **`wait_for_callback` action** (`automation-actions.ts`) — union + `ALL_ACTION_TYPES` + config (no params; v1).
- **Migrations** — `zzzz20260603130000_create_automation_suspensions` (the suspension table, D3) +
  `zzzz20260603140000_add_wait_for_callback_automation_action` (widen `chk_automation_action_type`).
- **Executor** (`automation-executor.ts`) — `executeActions` gains `startIndex` + `wait_for_callback`
  detection (suspend via `onSuspend`, else **D7 fail-closed**); `executeActions` now returns
  `{ suspended }`; `execute()` leaves the execution `running` on suspend (D2); new `continueExecution()`
  settles the wait step + runs the tail from `startIndex`.
- **Job plane** (`automation-job-service.ts`) — `writeSuspendedJob()` (the `suspended` C1 job, D2);
  resume settles it via the existing `onSettled` (suspended→resolved).
- **Suspension service** (`automation-suspension-service.ts`, NEW) — `create()` (suspension row +
  suspended job, A1-redacted trigger_event), `findByToken()`, transactional single-use `claim()` (D8),
  `computeActionFingerprint()` (D4b).
- **Service** (`automation-service.ts`) — `onSuspend` wired into the opt-in `jobLifecycleFactory`;
  `resumeExecution()` (discriminated result mirroring `retryExecution`): re-load current rule (D4) →
  fingerprint guard (D4b) → re-fetch record (D4) → claim (D8) → `continueExecution` → persist.
- **Route** (`routes/automation.ts`) — `POST /api/multitable/automation/resume`, **`requireAdminRole()`**
  (D5), `confirmSideEffects` gate, persisted-redacted serialization (same as retry).
- **DB types** (`db/types.ts`) — `MultitableAutomationSuspensionsTable` registered.

## Test results (real Postgres `metasheet_test`, local)

- **A6-2 real-DB T1–T9 — 10/10 PASS** (`tests/integration/multitable-automation-suspend-resume.test.ts`,
  wired into `plugin-tests.yml`): T1 suspend (execution `running`, suspension `pending`+token, job[1]
  `suspended`, job[2] absent, job[0] resolved) · T2 resume → success, all jobs resolved, suspension
  `resumed`, `initiatedBy` stamped · T3 double-resume → 409 · T4 unknown token → 404 · T5 legacy
  fail-closed (no suspension) · T6 trigger_event redacted · T7 rule-disabled → 409 (token NOT consumed) ·
  T8 rule-changed → 409 (D4b) · T9 record-missing → 404. **T1 also asserts the suspended READ path** —
  `listByExecution` surfaces the descriptor-less `suspended` job view without throwing.
- **No regressions:** A6-1 jobs real-DB **5/5**; action-type migration tests **6/6** (send_email delta +
  new wait_for_callback sync); `automation-runs-api` **24/24** (admin-gate count 3→4 confirms the resume
  route IS gated; **a suspended execution renders via the detail route** — 200, status `running`, suspended
  step visible, no `normalizeWorkflowJob` throw; resume route confirm-gate 400s / 404 / 200);
  backend **`tsc --noEmit` 0 errors**; full unit sweep **2673+ pass**.
- **Pre-existing env-only failures (NOT A6-2):** `data-source-scope` (mysql2 driver) +
  `multitable-e2e-helper-env` (@playwright/test) fail to *module-load* in the symlinked-node_modules
  worktree; both files are untouched by A6-2 and pass under CI's real `pnpm install`.

## Deltas / as-built notes vs the design-lock

1. **Action-type CHECK constraint (not in the design).** `automation_rules.action_type` has a
   `chk_automation_action_type` CHECK constraint kept in sync with `ALL_ACTION_TYPES` by a unit test.
   Adding `wait_for_callback` required a 2nd migration to widen it; the sync test moved to the new
   migration's spec (the send_email spec now locks only its own delta). Caught by the existing test, not
   in prod.
2. **D2 validated against the read path (pre-edit gate).** `routes/automation.ts:119`
   (`execution.status !== 'running' && jobs.some(non-terminal)`) short-circuits for a suspended-but-
   `running` execution (legitimate, jobs view preferred), and `C1_FUTURE_STATUSES` already lists
   `suspended` (filter → empty). So the legacy unions/bridges are UNCHANGED — zero ripple, as designed.
3. **A3 list filter (inherited).** Under D2 the runs **list** filter `status=suspended` returns empty
   (suspended runs list as `running`); the suspended state shows in the **detail** via the job plane.
   Pre-existing intentional contract — carry into A6-2b (surface a derived "suspended" indicator there).
4. **T9 reframed.** `meta_records` has a FK to `meta_sheets`, so insert-then-delete needs a sheet; a
   recordId absent at resume exercises the **same** `404 record_gone` code path (re-fetch → 0 rows).

## Review round 1 — REQUEST CHANGES addressed (2026-06-03)
Owner diff-review flagged 3 state-consistency / C1-contract blockers; all fixed and re-verified (counts above):
- **B1 — C1 contract:** a `suspended` job view was descriptor-less, so it would be rejected by
  `normalizeWorkflowJob` (a shape that only *resembled* C1). Fix: `listByExecution` attaches the
  `suspend: { reason, resumeToken }` descriptor from the suspension table (single source of truth) → a
  VALID C1 WorkflowJob. T1 now asserts `normalizeWorkflowJob(suspendedView)` does **not** throw. The token
  in this admin-gated read is also how a v1 admin obtains it to resume (no external emitter).
- **B2 — atomicity:** the suspension row + the `suspended` C1 job are now written in ONE transaction
  (`AutomationSuspensionService.create` via `db.transaction`), so a half-written suspend can't leave a
  dangling pending-suspension-without-job (or vice versa) that a later resume could observe.
- **B3 — token consumed too early:** `resumeExecution` now reads the execution row **before** the claim
  (a missing/unreadable execution no longer consumes the single-use token — it stays `pending`,
  recoverable), and `continueExecution` settles the execution to a terminal `failed` on ANY post-claim
  failure (the wait-step settle moved INSIDE the try) instead of bubbling a 500 with the token consumed
  and the tail unrun.

## Review round 2 — B1 race + token-surface (2026-06-03)
- **B1 race (blocking, fixed):** round-1 hydrated the descriptor only from `status='pending'`
  suspensions, but resume claims the token (`pending`→`resumed`) BEFORE it settles the wait job — so a
  still-`suspended` job can coexist with a `resumed` suspension (the post-claim window, or a durable
  wait-settle failure) and lose its descriptor again. Fix: hydrate by `execution_id`/`step_index`
  **regardless of suspension status**. New **T10** asserts a `resumed` suspension + a still-`suspended`
  job → `listByExecution` returns a valid C1 (descriptor present, `normalizeWorkflowJob` does not throw).
- **Token surface (owner-accepted option 1):** the `resume_token` is surfaced **admin-detail-only** —
  the C1 suspend descriptor rides the detail route (`GET /automation-executions/:id`); the LIST route uses
  legacy steps and never carries it. Stale code comments updated to the real contract ("admin detail is
  the v1 token surface", not "never in the read plane / emitted on suspend").

## Red lines honored
No delay/timer · no worker/claim · no branch/parallel · no BPMN · no approval-as-job · **no public
endpoint / no token emitter** (admin-gated only) · no K3 / central RBAC / integration-core / contract.

## Remaining (separate opt-ins)
A6-2b frontend (configure the action + surface suspended runs) · public webhook endpoint + token emitter
(when a real consumer exists) · sequential-multi-wait stress · A6-3+ (branch / BPMN / approval-as-job).
