# Archive Runtime Integration Verification

Status: LOCAL CHECKPOINT ONLY; remaining runtime gates are open.

Code: `22d9fbcd6eefcfc752e953a79b9cf96341dd2836`.
Tree: `756d1e7152ad4a2b732ae68525f5b8dda582cf7f`.
Base: `062614f4407b3d9bffc82dae266071b8a6e5e5bd`.

## Executed

From `packages/core-backend`:

```sh
pnpm exec vitest run --config vitest.config.ts \
  tests/unit/recovery-actor-authority.test.ts \
  tests/unit/recovery-explicit-read-authority.test.ts \
  tests/unit/multitable-permission-service.test.ts \
  tests/unit/multitable-stored-data-taint-chokepoint.guard.test.ts \
  tests/unit/multitable-exact-anchor-recovery-route.test.ts \
  tests/unit/multitable-recovery-archive-async-restore.test.ts
```

Result: 6 files / 132 tests PASS. This covers combined unit policy/wiring, not live worker recovery. `pnpm run type-check` passed. `git diff --check BASE..HEAD` passed.

Three true merges preserve the recorded source heads as ancestors. The exact-anchor test insertion conflict was resolved by concatenating both complete parent test blocks: two account-invalidity cases and one foreign-base revocation case. A mechanical comparison confirmed both blocks are byte-identical to their respective parents. No production conflict required manual resolution.

## Not Yet Proven Here

- Combined real-DB route and worker execution, mutation, and process-restart gates.
- Shared full-read/plan authorization invoked by a real background worker.
- Provider/KMS/object-store integration or ordinary application startup readiness.
- Remote CI, PR publication, merge, staging, UAT or production readiness.

Constituent PR reports remain SHA-scoped; their prior DB/mutation evidence does not replace these combined gates. No extra reviewer was invoked for this integration checkpoint.
