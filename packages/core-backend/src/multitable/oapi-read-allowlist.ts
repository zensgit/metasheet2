/**
 * OAPI-1 read-route allowlist (open-API token auth — design-lock
 * docs/development/multitable-openapi-token-auth-designlock-20260619.md).
 *
 * The global JWT gate (index.ts) 401s any non-JWT bearer. An `mst_` API token must reach the per-route
 * `apiTokenAuth` + `requireScope` guards to authenticate — but ONLY on the exact read routes below.
 * This matcher is the single fail-closed switch the gate consults: an `mst_` bearer on a listed read
 * route passes through (the route then validates the token + enforces scope); an `mst_` bearer ANYWHERE
 * else falls through to `jwtAuthMiddleware` → 401. Keep this in lockstep with the routes that mount
 * `apiTokenAuth` (univer-meta.ts). Read-only by construction: no write/side-effecting path is listed,
 * so a token can never reach one (it 401s there).
 *
 * OAPI-1 scope (univer-meta read surface): `records:read` — GET /records (list), /records/:id (single),
 * /view, /sheets/:sheetId/view-aggregate, /records-summary; and `fields:read` — GET /fields. All apply the
 * creator's row-deny + field-permission stack per-request (Option A). `comments:read` (a narrow set in
 * `comments.ts`) is also allowlisted now and composes `requireScope` with the existing `rbacGuard` =
 * min(token scope, creator RBAC); its per-user surfaces (inbox/unread-count/mention-*) stay deferred.

/**
 * THE auth boundary. Each pattern must be in **exact lockstep** with a route that mounts BOTH
 * `apiTokenAuth` + `requireScope` (univer-meta.ts), and every pattern is **anchored `^…$`**. Rationale:
 * a match lets an `mst_` bearer SKIP the global JWT gate to reach those per-route guards. An OVER-match
 * (a path with no guards) would be a silent no-auth bypass — `requireScope` fail-opens when no token
 * scopes are attached. Under-match merely 401s a token (harmless). So: anchor everything; never add a
 * pattern without the matching mounted guards; keep the adjacent-route exclusions below intentional.
