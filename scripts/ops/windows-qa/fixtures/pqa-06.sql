-- PQA-06 — Ambiguous evidence — synthetic fixtures (create + cleanup).
-- Draft/HOLD. Synthetic data only (all identifiers prefixed qa_synth_).
-- Run against the isolated database metasheet_windows_qa ONLY. Never a shared/customer DB.
--
-- Seeds admin + punching user in BOTH qa_synth_org_a (R1: work-date attribution ambiguity ->
-- HTTP 422, no fabricated projection) and qa_synth_org_shadow (R2: duplicate segment match ->
-- outcome='review_required' with projection_effect='none'; needs W4 enabled per PQA-05).
-- Overlapping shifts / duplicate punches are produced by the product in the steps.
