-- PQA-10 — Scheduled identity/outcome/outbox — synthetic fixtures (create + cleanup).
-- Draft/HOLD. Synthetic data only (all identifiers prefixed qa_synth_).
-- Run against the isolated database metasheet_windows_qa ONLY. Never a shared/customer DB.
--
-- Seeds admin + absence-eligible user in qa_synth_org_shadow (W4 enabled per PQA-05). Scheduled-run
-- rows are produced by the admin trigger route + sweep worker in the steps.
